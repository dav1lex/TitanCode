        "challengeText": "The primary challenge was to design and build a complete, secure, and reliable auction system from scratch using pure PHP, including a custom MVC framework. The goal was to avoid over-engineering and create a clean, maintainable codebase focused on core auction functionalities.",
        "solutionText": "A custom MVC architecture was implemented to structure the application logically. PDO with prepared statements is used for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection. A custom router handles all requests, directing them to the appropriate controllers. The frontend was built with Bootstrap 5, ensuring a professional and responsive user experience."
